# Tutorial Program for AI Integration

To start learning, kindly check out the [tutorial documentation]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-PEbfr-d2vKXEa7U71PXefYynfjTK5xx/view?usp=sharing)). As you go along the tutorial, kindly commit and push the relevant assets you created, including:

1. web application where you deployed your model,
2. the ipynb notebook used to train the model integrated into the web app, and
3. the dataset you used to train the model.

The kind of model you train can be any of those covered in the tutorials (e.g., cats vs dogs, sign language digits). 

The skills you gain in this tutorial program are crucial as you integrate a banana disease classifier into our web application.
